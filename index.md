# Notes
About what I learned and what I solved.

My specializations are Algorithms and Intelligent Systems. Thus, most of my upper division course work are related to these two fields.

## Algorithms

**Algorithms are very interesting!**

Many algorithms here are from [CS161 Design and Analysis of Algorithms](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/161/) and [CS163 Graph Algorithms](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/teach/graph/). I write Python codes to enhance my understanding on those algorithms.

A small portion of algorithms and examples are from Online Coding Interview Practice websites such as [Hackerrank](hackerrank.com) and [LeetCode](leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/).

## Notes for courses
Because of the [Policy about Academic Integrity](https://aisc.uci.edu/redirect-honesty.php?from=index.php) at UCI, I am not able to post my coursework online. If you are interested in knowing what I have done for CS courses in the following topics, please email me: <jennyzengzzh@gmail.com>

**Note:** I use Haroopad to write Markdown files because it has many interesting features. However, they may not show properly on GitHub. Quiz reviews below are linked to converted html web pages. If you are interested in reading the original markdown files, you can still find them in CS171 directory.
